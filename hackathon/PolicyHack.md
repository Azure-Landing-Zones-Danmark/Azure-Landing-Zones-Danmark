## Housekeeping


- Create your own branch of this repository - donÂ´t work directly from the main branch
- submit pull requests to comit your changes back to the main branch
- you will have a Read Only account to the Test Azure Environment - everythinng must be deployed via Service Principle and CI/CD pipeline
- For every Policy assignment consider how to handle exception
- For every Policy assignment created consider how to support the [Canary Management Group stucture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/testing-approach)
- Collect the feedback from the [Security Control Mapping process](../docs/Danmark-azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx). This will provide guidance and structure the code you contribute to this repository.

## Hackathon challenges

You will be split into groups and can voulunteer to accept any of the following challenges. Alternatively you can agree your own challenge with the group using the outcome of the [Security Control Mapping process](../docs/Danmark-azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx)

---
&nbsp;

1. Create the Management Group structure

    - Clone this repository into your and run the pipeline to create the Management Group structure
    - Make sure the naming convention of the Management Groups (especially the psuedo-root group) matches your organisation name
    - Make sure to consider how to use the [Canary Management Group stucture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/testing-approach)

---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

2. Create an Assignment Azure Security Baseline

    - Create a CI/CD pipeline that assigns [Azure Security Benchmark](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/overview) at the Pseudo root Group
    - consider how to handle [exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) for this assignment


---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

3. Azure Defender for Cloud

    - Create an initative, assignment and Azure Pipeline that deploys and configures Azure Defender for Cloud
    - Consider the custom policies already available in the Azure Landing Zones that are already [synced into this repoistory](../modules/policies/definitions). These Policies and Intiatives are documented in the [Security Control Mapping spreadsheeet](../docs/Danmark-azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx)
    - consider how to handle [exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) for this assignment

---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

4. Diagnostic Settings

    - create initative, assignment and Azure Pipeline that deploys and configures Diagnostics Settings
    - is there a need for custom policies
    - are these settings covered in other initiatives? Consider the custom policies already available in the Azure Landing Zones that are already [synced into this repoistory](../modules/policies/definitions). These Policies and Intiatives are documented in the [Security Control Mapping spreadsheeet](../docs/Danmark-azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx)
    - consider how to handle [exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) for this assignment

---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

5. HSM, Key Vault and Cryptography for Confidential Landing Zones

    - create initative, assignment and Azure Pipeline that deploys and configures [Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/policy-reference)
    - What are the requirements for Configdental / Sovereign / National Security workloads
    - What policies do we need for [Azure Managed HSM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview) ?
    - consider how to handle [exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) for this assignment
    - Consider other Azure Key Vault polices that could be relevant for Confidential subscriptions

---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


6. Deploy ESLZ custom policy

    - Create a CI/CD pipeline that creates the ESLZ custom policy defintions and policy defintion sets
    - pay attention to where the policy is created in the Management Group hierachy
    - consider how to handle [exceptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure) for this assignment

---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

7. Create Custom Policies (Audit, DINE, Append, Modify, Deny?)

    - use the outcome of the [Security Control Mapping process](../docs/Danmark-azure-security-benchmark-v3.0.xlsx) to create custom Azure Policy

---
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


8. Create CI/CD Pipelines to create and assign new Policy initatives
