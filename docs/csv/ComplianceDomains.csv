NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5,,
,AC - ACCESS CONTROL,"The Access Control family contains controls that cover access to systems, networks, and devices. Controls provide guidance on the implementation of access policies, account management, and topics like user privileges. The controls aim to lower the risk of unapproved access to a range of systems, devices, or networks"
,AT - AWARENESS AND TRAINING,"The Awareness and Training family of controls helps to ensure users of information systems are adequately trained to identify threats. A particular focus is improving awareness of different operational risks and threats to privacy or system security. Requirements around the creation of training policy, records, and feedback helps to fine-tune the organization’s approach to cybersecurity training."
,AU - AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY,"The Audit and Accountability family of controls provides guidance on procedures for event logging and auditing. Controls cover the baseline content of audit records, the capacity of log storage, and the process for monitoring and reviewing logs. Log audits are an important part of identifying the cause of breaches or system issues, and are a tool for accountability."
,"CA - ASSESSMENT, AUTHORIZATION, AND MONITORING","The Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring family focuses on the continuous monitoring and improvement of security and privacy controls. It covers the creation of an assessment plan and the delegation of the team to carry out control assessment. Controls also cover the creation of a plan of action and milestones (POAM), an integral document for identifying and fixing vulnerabilities or weaknesses."
,CM - CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT,"The Configuration Management family contains controls focusing on the configuration of software and devices on the network. Controls cover the creation of a configuration policy, the creation of a baseline configuration of the system, and the management of unauthorized configuration or devices. Configuration controls lower the risk of unauthorized hardware or software being installed on the system, or vulnerabilities caused by changes to settings."
,CP - CONTINGENCY PLANNING,"The Contingency Planning family contains controls to prepare organizations for system failures and breaches. Controls cover the planning for alternative processing or storage sites and the creation of system backups to help mitigate system downtime. Other controls focus on contingency planning, including training and plan testing. This family of controls is important for mitigating the damage from a system outage or network breach, establishing clear plans to restore normal operation."
,IA - IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION,"The Identification and Authentication family contains controls for the reliable identification of users and devices. Different controls focus on different elements of safe user or device authentication. Controls strengthen user management policies, lowering the risk of unauthorized access to the system."
,IR - INCIDENT RESPONSE,"The Incident Response family contains controls for all aspects of responding to a serious incident. This includes training and planning for potential incidents, as well as plans for actively monitoring and responding to incidents as they occur. Enhanced controls cover specific types of incidents that distinct organizations might face. Incidents may include data breaches, breakdowns in the supply chain, public relations damage, or malicious code in the system."
,MA - MAINTENANCE,"The Maintenance family of controls deals with all elements of system maintenance, including software updates, logging, and inspection tools. It covers the need for timely maintenance to lower the risk of operational outages, and outlines policy and the management of maintenance personnel."
,MP - MEDIA PROTECTION,"The Media Protection family of controls covers the use, storage and safe destruction of media and files in the organization. Established policies and procedures help to lower the risk of information breaches and leaks"
,PE - PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,"The Physical and Environmental Protection family of controls covers physical access to devices and facilities, and the mitigation of threats to facilities. Controls cover policies for physical access to system controls, including monitoring access and visitors, as well as the monitoring of devices and assets. Other controls cover responses to physical threats, such as emergency lighting or power and the relocation to alternative facilities."
,PL - PLANNING,"The Planning family of controls covers privacy and system security plans (SSPs), including system architecture, management processes, and the setting of baseline system settings"
,PM - PROGRAM MANAGEMENT,"The Program Management family of controls covers all elements of the management of an information system, including a variety of processes, programs, and plans. This includes an information security program plan, risk management strategy, and critical infrastructure plan."
,PS - PERSONNEL SECURITY,The Personnel Security family of controls covers different policies and procedures around the management of personnel. This includes the process for terminating personnel contracts and the relative risk of each position to information security. 
,PT - PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND TRANSPARENCY,"The PII Processing and Transparency family of controls helps to safeguard sensitive data, focusing on consent and privacy. Organizations can lower the risk of data breaches by properly managing personally identifiable information."
,RA - RISK ASSESSMENT,"The Risk Assessment family of controls focuses on the assessment of system vulnerabilities and relevant risk. Controls cover the development of risk response procedures, and the use of vulnerability monitoring tools and processes."
,SA - SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION,"The System and Services Acquisition family of controls includes the allocation of resources and the creation of system development life cycles. Controls help organizations create a safe acquisition process for new systems and devices, safeguarding the integrity of the wider system and data. Controls also cover the development and testing process for new systems, including developer training and security processes."
