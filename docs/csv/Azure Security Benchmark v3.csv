1.3",Establish network segmentation boundaries ,"Ensure that your virtual network deployment aligns to your enterprise segmentation strategy defined in the GS-2 security control. Any workload that could incur higher risk for the organization should be in isolated virtual networks. 
Examples of high-risk workload include:
- An application storing or processing highly sensitive data.
- An external network-facing application accessible by the public or users outside of your organization.
- An application using insecure architecture or containing vulnerabilities that cannot be easily remediated.

To enhance your enterprise segmentation strategy, restrict or monitor traffic between internal resources using network controls. For specific, well-defined applications (such as a 3-tier app), this can be a highly secure ""deny by default, permit by exception"" approach by restricting the ports, protocols, source, and destination IPs of the network traffic. If you have many applications and endpoints interacting with each other, blocking traffic may not scale well, and you may only be able to monitor traffic. ","Create a virtual network (VNet) as a fundamental segmentation approach in your Azure network, so resources such as VMs can be deployed into the VNet within a network boundary. To further segment the network, you can create subnets inside VNet for smaller sub-networks.

Use network security groups (NSG) as a network layer control to restrict or monitor traffic by port, protocol, source IP address, or destination IP address.  

You can also use application security groups (ASGs) to simplify complex configuration. Instead of defining policy based on explicit IP addresses in network security groups, ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure, allowing you to group virtual machines and define network security policies based on those groups.

If legacy password-based authentication is still used for Azure AD authentication, be aware that cloud-only accounts (user accounts created directly in Azure) have a default baseline password policy. And hybrid accounts (user accounts that come from on-premises Active Directory) follow the on-premises password policies. 

For third-party applications and services that may have default IDs and passwords, you should disable or change them during initial service setup.","How to enable MFA in Azure:

Limit the number of privileged/administrative accounts in your cloud's control plane, management plane and data/workload plane. ","Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Azure's default identity and access management service. The most critical built-in roles in Azure AD are Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator, because users assigned to these two roles can delegate administrator roles. With these privileges, users can directly or indirectly read and modify every resource in your Azure environment:
- Global Administrator / Company Administrator: Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure AD, as well as services that use Azure AD identities.
- Privileged Role Administrator: Users with this role can manage role assignments in Azure AD, as well as within Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of PIM and administrative units.

Outside of the Azure AD, Azure has built-in roles that can be critical for privileged access at the resource level.
- Owner: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC.
- Contributor: Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries.
- User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources.
Note: You may have other critical roles that need to be governed if you use custom roles in the Azure AD level or resource level with certain privileged permissions assigned. 

Ensure that you also restrict privileged accounts in other management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business-critical assets, such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems.

When conducting remote scans, do not use a single, perpetual, administrative account. Consider implementing JIT (Just In Time) provisioning methodology for the scan account. Credentials for the scan account should be protected, monitored, and used only for vulnerability scanning.

Note: Azure Defender services (including Defender for server, container registry, App Service, SQL, and DNS) embed certain vulnerability assessment capabilities.

Behavioral patterns such as excessive number of failed login attempts, and deprecated accounts in the subscription, should be alerted. ","Azure AD provides the following logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:
- Sign-ins: The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.
- Audit logs: Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
- Risky sign-ins: A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
- Users flagged for risk: A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure AD also provides an Identity Protection module to detect, and remediate risks related to user accounts and sign-in behaviors. Examples risks include leaked credentials, sign-in from anonymous or malware linked IP addresses, password spray. The policies in the Azure AD Identity Protection allow you to enforce risk-based MFA authentication in conjunction with Azure Conditional Access on user accounts.

In addition, Microsoft Defender for Cloud can be configured to alert on deprecated accounts in the subscription and suspicious activities such as an excessive number of failed authentication attempts. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (such as virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (such as SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you to see account anomalies inside the individual resources.

Note: If you are connecting your on-premises Active Directory for synchronization, use the Microsoft Defender for Identity solution to consume your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.","Audit activity reports in Azure AD:

Be mindful about different type of logs for security, audit, and other operation logs at the management/control plane and data plane tiers. There are three types of the logs available at the Azure platform:
- Azure resource log: Logging of operations that are performed within an Azure resource (the data plane). For example, getting a secret from a key vault or making a request to a database. The content of resource logs varies by the Azure service and resource type.
- Azure activity log: Logging of operations on each Azure resource at the subscription layer, from the outside (the management plane). You can use the Activity Log to determine the what, who, and when for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE) taken on the resources in your subscription. There is a single Activity log for each Azure subscription.
- Azure Active Directory logs: Logs of the history of sign-in activity and audit trail of changes made in the Azure Active Directory for a particular tenant.

- Artifact repositories that store source code, built packages and images, project artifacts and business data.
- Servers, services, and tooling that hosting CI/CD pipelines.
- CI/CD pipeline configuration.","As part of applying the Azure Security Benchmark to your DevOps infrastructure security controls, prioritize the following controls:
- Protect artifacts and underlying environment to ensure the CI/CD pipelines don’t become avenues to insert malicious code. For example, review your CI/CD pipeline to identify any misconfiguration in core areas of Azure DevOps such as Organization, Projects, Users, Pipelines (Build & Release), Connections, and Build Agent to identify any misconfigurations such as open access, weak authentication, insecure connection setup and so on. For GitHub, use the similar controls to secure the Organization permission levels 
- Configure identity/role permissions and entitlement policies in Azure AD, native services, and CI/CD tools in your pipeline to ensure changes to the pipelines are authorized.
- Avoid providing permanent “standing” privileged access to the human accounts such as developers or testers by using features such as Azure managed identifies, just-in-time access.
- Remove keys, credentials, and secrets from code and scripts used in CI/CD workflow jobs and keep them in key store or Azure Key Vault. 
- If you run self-hosted build/deployment agents, follow Azure Security Benchmark controls including network security, posture and vulnerability management, and endpoint security to secure your environment.","DevSecOps controls overview – secure pipelines:

Use Azure Security Benchmark to evaluate the controls (such as network security, identity management, privileged access and so on) that can be set as guardrails by default or shift left prior to the deployment stage. In particular, ensure the following controls are in place in your DevOps process: 
- Automate the deployment by using Azure or third-party tooling in the CI/CD workflow, infrastructure management (infrastructure as code), and testing to reduce human error and attack surface. 
- Ensure VMs, container images and other artifacts are secure from malicious manipulation. 
- Scan the workload artifacts (in other words, container images, dependencies, SAST and DAST scans) prior to the deployment in the CI/CD workflow
- Deploy vulnerability assessment and threat detection capability into the production environment and continuously use these capabilities in the run-time.","Guidance for Azure VMs:
- Use Azure Shared Image Gallery to share and control access to your images by different users, service principals, or AD groups within your organization. Use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users can access your custom images. 
- Define the secure configuration baselines for the VMs to eliminate unnecessary credentials, permissions, and packages. Through custom images, Azure Resource Manager template, and/or Azure Policy guest configuration to deploy and enforce these the configuration baseline.

Guidance for Azure container services: 
- Use Azure Container Registry (ACR) to create your private container registry where a granular access can be restricted through Azure RBAC, so only authorized services and accounts can access the containers in the private registry. 
- Use Defender for Azure Container Registry for vulnerability assessment of the images in your private Azure Container Registry. In addition, you can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud to ingrate container images scan as part of your CI/CD workflows.

","Mandate the security controls as part of the organization’s DevOps engineering and operation standard. Define the security objectives, control requirements, and tooling specifications in accordance with enterprise and cloud security standards in your organization. 

Encourage the use of DevOps as an essential operating model in your organization for its benefits in rapidly identifying and remediating vulnerabilities using different type of automations (such as infrastructure as code provision, and automated SAST and DAST scan) throughout the CI/CD workflow. This ‘shift left’ approach also increases visibility and ability to enforce consistent security checks in your deployment pipeline, effectively deploying security guardrails into the environment ahead of time to avoid last minute security surprises when deploying a workload into production.

When shifting security controls left into the pre-deployment phases, implement security guardrails to ensure the controls are deployed and enforced throughout your DevOps process. This technology could include Azure ARM templates to define guardrails in the IaC (infrastructure as code), resource provisioning and Azure Policy to audit and restrict which services or configurations can be provisioned into the environment.

For the run-time security controls of your workload, follow the Azure Security Benchmark to design and implement effective the controls, such as identity and privileged access, network security, endpoint security, and data protection inside your workload applications and services.
