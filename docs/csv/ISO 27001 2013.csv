For Azure Backup supported resources, backup data is automatically encrypted using Azure platform-managed keys with 256-bit AES encryption. You can also choose to encrypt the backups using customer managed key. In this case, ensure this customer-managed key in the Azure Key Vault is also in the backup scope. If you use customer-managed key options, use soft delete and purge protection in Azure Key Vault to protect keys from accidental or malicious deletion. For on-premises backups using Azure Backup, encryption-at-rest is provided using the passphrase you provide. 

Safeguard backup data from accidental or malicious deletion (such as ransomware attacks/attempts to encrypt or tamper backup data. For Azure Backup supported resources, enable soft delete to ensure recovery of items with no data loss for up to 14 days after an unauthorized deletion, and enable multifactor authentication using a PIN generated in the Azure portal.

ASB_DP-6,Use a secure key management process,"Use Azure Key Vault to create and control your encryption keys life cycle, including key generation, distribution, and storage. Rotate and revoke your keys in Azure Key Vault and your service based on the defined schedule and when there is a key retirement or compromise.

When there is a need to use customer-managed key (CMK) in the workload services or applications, ensure you follow the best practices:
- Use a key hierarchy to generate a separate data encryption key (DEK) with your key encryption key (KEK) in your key vault. 
- Ensure keys are registered with Azure Key Vault and implement via key IDs in each service or application.

If you need to bring your own key (BYOK) to the services (i.e., importing HSM-protected keys from your on-premises HSMs into Azure Key Vault), follow the recommended guideline to perform the key generation and key transfer. 

Note: Refer to the below for the FIPS 140-2 level for Azure Key Vault types and FIPS compliance level.

ASB_IR-5,Detection and analysis - prioritize incidents,"Microsoft Defender for Cloud assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytics used to issue the alert, as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark resources using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It is your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.","SQL: Azure Defender for SQL should be enabled for unprotected Azure SQL servers: https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fabfb4388-5bf4-4ad7-ba82-2cd2f41ceae9

ASB_LT-2,Enable threat detection for  identity and access management,"Azure AD provides the following logs that can be viewed in Azure AD reporting or integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel or other SIEM/monitoring tools for more sophisticated monitoring and analytics use cases:
- Sign-ins: The sign-ins report provides information about the usage of managed applications and user sign-in activities.
- Audit logs: Provides traceability through logs for all changes done by various features within Azure AD. Examples of audit logs include changes made to any resources within Azure AD like adding or removing users, apps, groups, roles and policies.
- Risky sign-ins: A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might have been performed by someone who is not the legitimate owner of a user account.
- Users flagged for risk: A risky user is an indicator for a user account that might have been compromised.

Azure AD also provides an Identity Protection module to detect, and remediate risks related to user accounts and sign-in behaviors. Examples risks include leaked credentials, sign-in from anonymous or malware linked IP addresses, password spray. The policies in the Azure AD Identity Protection allow you to enforce risk-based MFA authentication in conjunction with Azure Conditional Access on user accounts.

In addition, Microsoft Defender for Cloud can be configured to alert on deprecated accounts in the subscription and suspicious activities such as an excessive number of failed authentication attempts. In addition to the basic security hygiene monitoring, Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Threat Protection module can also collect more in-depth security alerts from individual Azure compute resources (such as virtual machines, containers, app service), data resources (such as SQL DB and storage), and Azure service layers. This capability allows you to see account anomalies inside the individual resources.

Note: If you are connecting your on-premises Active Directory for synchronization, use the Microsoft Defender for Identity solution to consume your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.","Guest Configuration: Windows Defender Exploit Guard should be enabled on your machines: https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fbed48b13-6647-468e-aa2f-1af1d3f4dd40

ASB_PA-1,Separate and limit highly privileged/administrative users,"Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Azure's default identity and access management service. The most critical built-in roles in Azure AD are Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator, because users assigned to these two roles can delegate administrator roles. With these privileges, users can directly or indirectly read and modify every resource in your Azure environment:
- Global Administrator / Company Administrator: Users with this role have access to all administrative features in Azure AD, as well as services that use Azure AD identities.
- Privileged Role Administrator: Users with this role can manage role assignments in Azure AD, as well as within Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). In addition, this role allows management of all aspects of PIM and administrative units.

Outside of the Azure AD, Azure has built-in roles that can be critical for privileged access at the resource level.
- Owner: Grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC.
- Contributor: Grants full access to manage all resources, but does not allow you to assign roles in Azure RBAC, manage assignments in Azure Blueprints, or share image galleries.
- User Access Administrator: Lets you manage user access to Azure resources.
Note: You may have other critical roles that need to be governed if you use custom roles in the Azure AD level or resource level with certain privileged permissions assigned. 

Ensure that you also restrict privileged accounts in other management, identity, and security systems that have administrative access to your business-critical assets, such as Active Directory Domain Controllers (DCs), security tools, and system management tools with agents installed on business critical systems. Attackers who compromise these management and security systems can immediately weaponize them to compromise business critical assets.","Security Center: A maximum of 3 owners should be designated for your subscription: https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f4f11b553-d42e-4e3a-89be-32ca364cad4c

Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or ""break glass""' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency. You may also use additional controls, such dual controls (e.g., splitting the credential into two pieces and giving it to separate persons) to enhance the security of this process.

ASB_PV-5,Perform vulnerability assessments,"Follow recommendations from Microsoft Defender for Cloud for performing vulnerability assessments on your Azure virtual machines, container images, and SQL servers. Microsoft Defender for Cloud has a built-in vulnerability scanner for virtual machine scan. Use a third-party solution for performing vulnerability assessments on network devices and applications (e.g., web applications)

Export scan results at consistent intervals and compare the results with previous scans to verify that vulnerabilities have been remediated. When using vulnerability management recommendations suggested by Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can pivot into the selected scan solution's portal to view historical scan data.

When conducting remote scans, do not use a single, perpetual, administrative account. Consider implementing JIT (Just In Time) provisioning methodology for the scan account. Credentials for the scan account should be protected, monitored, and used only for vulnerability scanning.

Note: Azure Defender services (including Defender for server, container registry, App Service, SQL, and DNS) embed certain vulnerability assessment capabilities.

- Mishandling of confidential information pertaining to the organization or its customers in the course of transmission, processing or storage of such information  
- Concentration risk.  
  
Your organization is also recommended to establish service-level agreements (SLA) when engaging third-party service providers. Various regulations recommend that the SLA contain the following:  
- Access rights for the regulator and any party appointed by the organization to examine any activity or entity of the organization. This shall include access to any record, file or data of the financial institution, including management information and the minutes of all consultative and decision-making processes  
- Requirements for the service provider to provide sufficient prior notice to organizations of any sub-contracting which is substantial  
- A written undertaking by the service provider on compliance with secrecy provisions under relevant legislation. The SLA shall further clearly provide for the service provider to be bound by confidentiality provisions stipulated under the contract even after the engagement has ended  
- Arrangements for disaster recovery and backup capability, where applicable  
- Critical system availability  
- Arrangements to secure business continuity in the event of exit or termination of the service provider.  
  
Microsoft recommends that your organization ensure your organization's ability to regularly review the SLA with the third-party service providers. It is recommended that storage of data be logically segregated from the other clients of the third-party service providers. Any critical systems hosted by the third-party service providers are recommended to have strong recovery and resumption capabilities and provisions to facilitate an orderly exit in the event of failure or unsatisfactory performance by the third-party service provider. Microsoft recommends that board and senior management exercise effective oversight and address associated risks when engaging third-party service providers for critical technology functions and systems.

CMA_0208,Employ a media sanitization mechanism,"Microsoft recommends that your organization sanitize media prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse, using organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies. Consider deploying media sanitization mechanisms so that information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed; these mechanisms might include clearing, purging, cryptographic erasure, and physical destruction to prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Your organization may apply nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the information system. It is recommended to document processes and procedures for volatile and non-volatile media including overwriting, read back verification, ATA security erase command and removing power in microfiche, microfilm, optical discs, printer ribbons, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory and faulty magnetic media that cannot be sanitized. Microsoft also recommends your organization physically destroy or sanitize solid state and hybrid drives before disposal, and to not redeploy them in lower classification environments. Consider shredding, incinerating or pulping hardcopy materials so that data cannot be reconstructed. Microsoft also recommends obtaining and retain a certificate of destruction if the data disposal is outsourced to a third party.  
  
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requires organizations to implement controls around rendering cardholder data on electronic media unrecoverable so that cardholder data cannot be reconstructed. PCI DSS requires that organizations use any of the following approaches for rendering cardholder data including primary account numbers (PAN):  
-	One-way hashes based on strong cryptography (hash must be of the entire PAN)  
-	Truncation (hashing cannot be used to replace the truncated segment of PAN)  
-	Index tokens and pads (pads must be securely stored)  
-	Strong cryptography with associated key-management processes and procedures  
-	Sanitizing media prior to disposal, release out of control, or release for reuse using approved sanitization techniques  
  
The New Zealand Information Security Manual (NZISM) requires Agencies to:  
-	sanitize or destroy, then declassify, IT equipment containing any media before disposal  
-	return all the equipment and media that have processed or stored NZEO (New Zealand Eyes Only) information but cannot be sanitized to New Zealand for sanitization or destruction, declassification, and disposal along with contacting GCSB (Government Communications Security Bureau) to comply with any requirements for disposal for high assurance products, HGCE, TEMPEST rated IT equipment or if the equipment is non-functional  
-	in case of disposal of the IT equipment into the public domain, ensure a formal sanitization and then authorize such disposals  
-	verify that all classified information has been destroyed and doesn't persist on the screens of any television or monitor by visually inspecting the video screens and turning up the brightness to the maximum level  
-	attempt to sanitize video screens with minor burn-in or image persistence by displaying a solid white image on the screen for an extended period. If burn-in cannot be corrected the screen MUST be processed through a destruction facility  
-	follow the guidance in the NZISM for any redeployment or disposal of monitors  
-	print at least three pages of random text with no blank areas on each color printer cartridge with an integrated drum or separate copier drum and to destroy any cartridge or drum that cannot be sanitized

For required services and protocols that are insecure, it is recommended that your organization document the business justification and implement additional security features to mitigate the risks. We also recommend that your organization identify, document, approve, monitor, and record changes and deviations from established configuration settings based on organization-defined operational requirements in accordance with your organization's policies and procedures using automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify configuration settings. Your organization should consider employing security safeguards to respond to unauthorized changes to organizational configuration settings.  
Your organization may implement Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) enabled tools in your organization. SCAP-enabled tools can be used for maintaining the security of enterprise systems such as automatically verifying the installation of patches, checking system security configuration settings against an expected baseline, and examining systems for signs of compromise.  
It is recommended that your organization reduce security risks by removing unessential programs, applications, account functions, permissions, access, and ports to reduce the attack surface. Microsoft recommends that your organization set access to content on internal or external ports to expire automatically at predefined intervals, where configurable.  
Your organization should consider using configuration standards to address all known security vulnerabilities and are consistent with industry-accepted system hardening standards. Sources of industry-accepted system hardening standards may include, but are not limited to:

-	Objectives  
-	Risk assessment tools and techniques  
-	Risk factors (i.e., Threat sources)  
-	Risk treatment options (i.e., Modify/reduce risk, retain risk, etc.)  
-	Risk tolerance and criteria for risk acceptance, including multiple thresholds with a desired target level of risk, requirements for future additional treatment, expressed as the ratio of estimated profit to the estimated risk  
-	Risk treatment plans  
-	Perform cost benefit analysis prior to selecting treatment plans or mitigating controls  
-	Roles and responsibilities, including staffing requirements to run the risk program, competencies and qualifications needed, and separation of duties  
  
It is also recommended that your organization appoint a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) or risk manager responsible for handling organizational risks. The CRO may report to the Senior management or management board and be responsible for managing risks relating to business or compliance with applicable acts and regulations. We recommend that the Chief Risk Officer or risk manager manage the communications related to risk with internal and external stakeholders. This role may also be responsible for measuring the performance of the risk management process prior to and when changes are made within the organization.  
  
In addition to a CRO in some organizations, especially financial organizations, it is recommended that a three-line defense approach be taken. These three lines are commonly business unit management, an independent corporate operational risk management function, and independent assurance. The first line of defense is typically responsible for identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products, activities, processes, and systems for which the business unit is responsible for. The second line of defense typically develops and provides an independent view regarding a business unit's risk and an assessment of the effectiveness of key controls. The third line typically provides independent assurance to the board and usually involves internal and external audit.  
Microsoft recommends the organization's risk strategy be agreed to by organizational stakeholders and undergo regular review. Where necessary, organization management can record the decision to accept the risks and responsibilities. This information along with other relevant information can be documented in a risk file. Ongoing monitoring for emerging risks and periodic review of all risk management processes and their outcomes can be conducted to drive continuous improvement. It is also recommended that your organization consider including an exit mechanism as part of your organization's risk management when there is a business or financial deterioration.  
  
Taiwan's Implementation Rules of Internal Audit and Internal Control System of Financial Holding Companies and Banking Industries states that organizations must implement finance-related risk principles and guidelines to establish the mechanisms for measuring and monitoring the capital adequacy, liquidity positions and liabilities to manage liquidity and investment risks.

CMA_0388,Perform a risk assessment,"Microsoft recommends that your organization perform a risk assessment at least annually and upon significant changes to the environment to address applicable security and privacy risks. We recommend performing these risk assessments to identify and address the key risks from existing and planned controls, critical assets and related consequences, threats and their sources, vulnerabilities, and technology projects. It is recommended that your organization document and distribute results of the risk assessment to key stakeholders and in a risk register. It is recommended that your organization review your risk assessment results through analyzing the identified qualitative and/or quantitative risks, assessing the impacts resulting from information security incidents, evaluating the incidents based on risk level against a defined risk evaluation and acceptance criteria, measuring the likelihood of the identified threats occurring, and determining the impact on the organization. We recommend using all-source intelligence when analyzing risk within your organization. All-source intelligence uses information from any available source, such as publicly available information and human, signals, imagery, and measurement and signature intelligence. This can enable your organization to analyze vulnerability risks that arise from different processes, people and the environment. Your organization can perform this analysis throughout the supply chain and make more informed cross-organization decisions. Your organization should update the risk assessment at a predetermined frequency or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system.  
It is also recommended that your organization understand the inherent risk of adopting cloud services and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment prior to cloud adoption. The assessment helps address risks associated with the location of cloud infrastructure, vendor lock-in and application portability, exposure to cyber-attacks via cloud service providers, termination, limitations, and liabilities of cloud service providers.   
Microsoft recommends that your organization inform other relevant parties, such as end users, about potential impacts resulting from risks and associated measures. Your organization may consider performing a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) prior to or in parallel with a risk assessment. Your organization may also consider creating a vulnerability and threat matrix to determine potential impact for a particular asset.  
Additionally, consider performing appropriate regular and ad hoc stress tests in respect of the material risks, based on the nature, scale, complexity and riskiness of the business activities, and include the results of stress tests and their potential impact on the risk situation and the available financial resources in the risk report.",,,Operational

- Ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide all security safeguards that rely on cryptography are under configuration management  
- Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system  
- Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system  
- Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system  
- Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses  
- Requires an information security representative to be a member of the configuration control board (CCB) or similar organization  
- Tests, validates, and documents changes to the information system before implementing the changes on the operational system  
- Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration controlled.",,,Operational
CMA_0391,Perform disposition review,"Microsoft recommends that your organization review content at the end of its retention period to decide whether it can be safely deleted (""disposed""). For example, your organization might need to:   
- Suspend the deletion (""disposition"") of relevant content in the event of litigation or an audit  
- Remove content from the disposition list to store in an archive, if that content has research or historical value  
- Assign a different retention period to the content, if the original policy was a temporary or provisional solution  
- Return the content to clients or transfer it to another organization.  
  
It is also recommended that your organization and suppliers maintain and provide the evidence that demonstrate that all forms of data/records/information (both electronic and physical) have been removed or deleted, destroyed or rendered unusable according to policy.  
  
Guidelines and Functional Requirements for Electronic Records Management Systems requires the electronic records management system of an organization to provide functionality to allow the administrator to delete aggregations/volumes/records and alert the administrator if an electronic aggregation that is due for destruction is referred to in a link from another aggregation and pause the destruction process to allow the appropriate remedial action to be taken. While executing disposition, the electronic system must produce an exception report for the administrator, ensure deletion of the entire contents of an aggregation or volume when commanded, prompt the administrator to enter a reason for the action and alert the administrators to any conflicts. The Guidelines also require the electronic records management system to support the review process and allow the reviewer to take an action and mark the aggregation for destruction, transfer, indefinite hold (pending litigation) and change the disposal authority (or assign a different schedule) so that the aggregation is retained and re-reviewed at a later date along with producing a disposal authority report and specifying the frequency of the report, the information reported and highlight exceptions such as overdue disposal.

CMA_0393,Perform vulnerability scans,"Microsoft recommends that your organization perform internal and external vulnerability scans and rescans to assess application and/or asset risks by using a dedicated account. It is recommended to perform such scans in accordance with regulatory requirements applicable to your organization, and at least on a quarterly basis. Your organization is recommended to perform the following:  
-	Internal quarterly vulnerability scanning performed by qualified personnel  
-	External quarterly vulnerability scanning performed by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV)  
-	Internal and external scanning as needed after significant changes  
Your vulnerability scans should include:  
-	Capability to readily update the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned  
-	Automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities  
-	Breadth and depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned, and vulnerabilities checked)  
-	Interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for measuring vulnerability impact  
The vulnerability assessment may be required to be conducted in a test environment as well as in a production environment for certain scenarios. Appropriate measures are required to perform such scans in the production environment considering it does not impact the operations. Approvals may be sought prior to conducting such scans. The outcomes of vulnerability assessment can be documented along with the details of the environment (e.g., test or production) and the difference in the operations of environments. Your organization should consider scenarios when performing vulnerability scans such as introducing a new asset or application, replacing an asset or application, prior to go-live of a new application, and more. It is recommended that your organization compare and correlate the results from vulnerability scanning tools to assess the existence of multi-hop and multi-vulnerability attack vectors. We recommend identifying what information is discoverable by external threats and taking remedial actions. Your organization should then notify appropriate service provider personnel and follow service provider-defined corrective actions.  
It is recommended that your organization remediate all weaknesses identified and repeat scanning until all vulnerabilities have been corrected. We recommend your organization to have a process in place for remediation or mitigation of vulnerabilities identified during monitoring processes by utilizing a risk-rating process to prioritize the remediation of flaws.  
Microsoft recommends that your organization create and maintain a vulnerability management plan that include details for identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities. It is also recommended to include reviewing historic audit logs under the vulnerability management plan to determine if a vulnerability identified in the information system has been previously exploited.",,,Operational

CMA_0538,Verify identity before distributing authenticators,"Microsoft recommends that your organization verify the identity of any individual, group, role, or device receiving an authenticator as part of the initial authenticator distribution process. It is recommended that the entire proofing process be done over authenticated protected channels to protect the data from unauthorized disclosure. The verification can be done in-person or remotely, and the verification of identity evidence can be done through knowledge-based verification, physical verification, or digital verification based on applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Your organization is recommended to determine the requirements for supervised remote identity proofing and enrollment transactions, such as having continuous monitoring of the user and training operators to detect fraud, among others. NIST 800-63A recommends using fraud mitigation measures to ensure confidence in identity proofing, such as inspecting geolocation, examining the device characteristics of the applicant, evaluating behavioral characteristics, validating the physical security of evidence, or checking vital statistic repositories such as the Death Master File (DMF). During the verification process, it is recommended that your organization determine maximum attempts allowed by the individual and session timeout requirements. Your organization may also consider allowing users to change the verification method if needed.  
  
It is recommended that all verification methods and processes are documented and distributed to relevant stakeholders. Your organization should consider creating and maintaining Identification and Authentication policies and standard operating procedures that include details for a process for verifying the identity of any entity receiving an authenticator.  
  
Your organization may use identity proofing as a way to verify identity before distributing authenticators.
